# influxQ
influxQ is a tool to query influxDB.

## Install
`sudo curl -L https://github.com/digitalroute/influxQ/releases/download/v0.1/influxQ -o /usr/local/bin/influxQ`
`sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/influxQ`

### Disclaimer
I have created this tool to make my own life easier since I have a need to explore and query different influxDB instances.
It's not a professional tool as I'm not quite a developer.
Feel free to hack it the way you'd like (pull requests or fork)

##### The reasons for existence of such a tool
* InfluxDB has dropped the support for the web interface.
* chronograf is not enough for data exploration. (Does not support tables)
* Graphana is fine, but too much for me.
